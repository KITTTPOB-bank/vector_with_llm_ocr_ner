description = Extract entities from resumes including:
    - RESUME_SKILL: Unique skills used by the candidate. Only keep the latest instance of each skill (no duplicates).
    If the skill has no specific time mentioned, assign the latest SKILL_DURATION or the most recent year found in the resume.
    - SKILL_DURATION: Year (e.g. 2023) when the skill or job was used. If a full date is found, extract only the year.
    - JOB_EXP: Total work experience in full years, based on job durations found in the resume.
